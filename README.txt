Yash Fashion Hub - Ready ZIP (phone-friendly)

How to produce APK from this ZIP using a phone (no PC):
1) Upload this ZIP to a Git service (GitHub/GitLab) using GitHub mobile app or any Git client:
   - Create a new repo, upload all files (flutter_app folder) to it.
2) Use a cloud CI builder like Codemagic (codemagic.io) or Appcircle:
   - Sign up on Codemagic (free tier).
   - Connect your GitHub repo.
   - Create a new Flutter Android build (select branch).
   - For a quick demo you can build an unsigned debug APK (no signing key).
   - After build completes, download APK to your phone and install.

If you want, I can:
- Give step-by-step screenshots or exact Codemagic settings.
- Help you push this repo to GitHub from your phone.
